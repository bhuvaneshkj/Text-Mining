Initially all the required libraries are insatlled.
NLTK is installed using conda prompt by "pip install NLTK"
Once NLTK is installed it is configured in the jupyter notebook by importing.
Other functions of NLTK is also imported. 
Once all libary is imported. The code is executed cell by cell in Jupyter notebook.

Dependancies:

The libaries which are used as described below. 

import nltk
from nltk.corpus import words
nltk.download('words')
from collections import Counter
import pandas as pd
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.metrics.distance  import edit_distance
import numpy as np

User needs to import all the libaries mentioned above.
